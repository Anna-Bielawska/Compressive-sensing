   The code written below was used for computer simulations included in the diploma thesis.
   It contains 4 original part-implementations of optimization algorithms: Basis Pursuit, Basic Thresholding, 
   Iterative Hard Thresholding, Hard Thresholding Pursuit, with use of scipy library. 
   There already existed an implementation of the 5th algorithm of interest, OMP - Orthogonal Matching Pursuit.
